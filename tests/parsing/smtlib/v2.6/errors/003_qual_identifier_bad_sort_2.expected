File "", line 1, character 32-33:
Error (003) while parsing a qualified identifier, read the reserved word '!',
      but expected a sort, i.e. either an identifier, or a sort constructor
      application; note that keywords (such as '_', 'as', ...) are none of
      these, and thus are not allowed here..
