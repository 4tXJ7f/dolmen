File "", line 1, character 31-32:
Error (040) while parsing an indexed identifier, read the reserved word '_',
      but expected an index, i.e. either a numeral, a symbol, or a
      hexadecimal number; note that keywords and reserved words (such as '_',
      'as', ...) are not symbols, and thus are not allowed here.
