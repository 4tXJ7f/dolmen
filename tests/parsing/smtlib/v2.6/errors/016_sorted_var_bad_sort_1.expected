File "", line 1, character 36-37:
Error (016) while parsing a sorted variable, read the reserved word '_',
      but expected a sort, i.e. either an identifier, or a sort constructor
      application; note that keywords and reserved words (such as '_', 'as',
      ...) are not identifiers, and thus are not allowed here.
