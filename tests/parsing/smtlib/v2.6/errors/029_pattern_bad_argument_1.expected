File "", line 1, character 145-146:
Error (029) while parsing arguments of a constructor in a pattern,
      read the reserved word '_',
      but expected a symbol to bind the first constructor argument; note that
      keywords and reserved words (such as '_', 'as', ...) are not symbols,
      and thus are not allowed here.
