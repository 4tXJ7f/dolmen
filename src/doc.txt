Dolmen provides functor to easily create parsers for some languages, and
standard implementation of the required arguments for the functors.

{4 Language classes}

Some languages have enough similarities in either synatx or purpose to be packed
into classes. Currently, the only class available is the {!Logic} class that regroup
languages used in formal proof.

{!modules:
Logic
}

{4 Standard implementations}

The following modules define standard implementations that can be used to directly
instantiate the parser functors.

{!modules:
Term
Statement
ParseLocation
}

{4 Interfaces}

The following modules synthesize the implementationr equirements for language classes:

{!modules:
Term_intf
Stmt_intf
Location_intf
}

{4 Language parsers}

Individual language parsers are available through the following modules:

{!modules:
Dimacs
Smtlib
Tptp
Zf
}
